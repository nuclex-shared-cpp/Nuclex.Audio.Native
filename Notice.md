Third-Party Code
================

This library also embeds carefully selected third-party code which falls
under its own licenses, listed below


FLAC audio codec reference implementation: BSD license
------------------------------------------------------

Uses code from libflac to encode and decode FLAC audio streams. While parts
of the FLAC codebase fall under different license, the libflac code is under
the BSD license (https://github.com/xiph/flac/blob/master/COPYING.Xiph).

If you distribute binaries compiled from this library, you do not have to
do anything, but an acknowledgement of the original author would be nice.


FLAC audio codec reference implementation: BSD license

Uses code from libflac to encode and decode FLAC audio streams. While parts
of the FLAC codebase fall under different license, the libflac code is under
the BSD license (https://github.com/xiph/flac/blob/master/COPYING.Xiph).

If you distribute binaries compiled from this library, you do not have to

There a are several patent holders to technologies used in the Opus codec
but these patents have been declared free to use within the context of
an Opus codec implementation (unless you sue one of the patent holders).

If you distribute binaries compiled from this library, you do not have to
do anything, but an acknowledgement of the original author would be nice.


Vorbis audio codec reference implementation: BSD license
--------------------------------------------------------

Uses libvorbis to encode and decode Vorbis audio streams. Libvorbis is
